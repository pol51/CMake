Daemon Mode
-----------

This branch implements a daemon mode for CMake. It is intended for
collaborators wishing to upstream this into CMake proper.  This
branch is not something for end users.

This will allow advanced IDE features such as

* Semantic highlighting
* Code completion
* Content debugging
* Contextual help

and more. See https://steveire.wordpress.com/2016/01/24/cmake-daemon-for-user-tools/ for details
